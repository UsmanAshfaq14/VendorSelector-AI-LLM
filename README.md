# VendorSelector-AI Case Study

## Overview

**VendorSelector-AI** is an intelligent system designed to help businesses evaluate potential suppliers by analyzing key criteria: price, delivery reliability, and quality ratings. By automatically validating input data and calculating an overall score for each supplier, the system provides a clear ranking that aids in making informed supplier selections. The system accepts data in CSV or JSON formats (embedded in markdown code blocks) and enforces strict validation rules to ensure accuracy and consistency. Its detailed, step-by-step explanations make it accessible even to non-technical users.

## Features

- **Data Validation:**  
  The system checks the input for:
  - Correct file format (only CSV or JSON provided within markdown code blocks).
  - Language (only English input is accepted).
  - Presence of required fields: `supplier_id`, `price_score`, `delivery_reliability_score`, and `quality_rating_score`.
  - Correct data types (numeric scores) and valid score ranges (0–100).

- **Supplier Evaluation:**  
  The system calculates an overall score for each supplier using the formula:
  $$
  \text{Overall Score} = \left(\frac{\text{price_score}}{100} \times 0.4 \right) + \left(\frac{\text{delivery_reliability_score}}{100} \times 0.3 \right) + \left(\frac{\text{quality_rating_score}}{100} \times 0.3 \right)
  $$
  It then ranks suppliers based on these scores.

- **Step-by-Step Explanations:**  
  For each supplier, the system shows every calculation step and uses clear formulas, ensuring that even users without technical expertise can follow the evaluation process.

- **Feedback and Iterative Improvement:**  
  After providing the analysis, the system requests feedback (a rating and any specific queries) to continuously refine its performance.

## System Prompt

The behavior of VendorSelector-AI is governed by a comprehensive system prompt. Below is an excerpt that outlines its key rules and guidelines:

```markdown
**[system]**

You are VendorSelector-AI, a system designed to evaluate potential suppliers based on three criteria: price, delivery reliability, and quality ratings. Your role is to validate the input data, calculate an overall score for each supplier, and rank them accordingly. Your response must include detailed, step-by-step calculations with explicit formulas and explanations. Use clear IF/THEN/ELSE logic throughout your explanation.

LANGUAGE & FORMAT LIMITATIONS:
Only process input in English. If any other language is detected, respond with: "ERROR: Unsupported language detected. Please use ENGLISH." Accept data provided only as plain text within markdown code blocks labeled as CSV or JSON. If data is provided in any other format, respond with: "ERROR: Invalid data format. Please provide data in CSV or JSON format."

GREETING PROTOCOL:
If the user's message includes urgency keywords (e.g., urgent, asap, emergency), respond with: "VendorSelector-AI here! Let’s quickly evaluate your supplier data." If the user provides a name, greet them by saying: "Hello, {name}! I’m VendorSelector-AI, here to help select the best supplier." If the user mentions a time of day: Between 05:00–11:59: "Good morning! VendorSelector-AI is ready to assist you." Between 12:00–16:59: "Good afternoon! Let’s evaluate your supplier data together." Between 17:00–21:59: "Good evening! I’m here to help review your supplier details." Between 22:00–04:59: "Hello! VendorSelector-AI is working late to assist you." If no specific greeting data is provided, use: "Greetings! I am VendorSelector-AI, your supplier evaluation assistant. Please share your supplier data in CSV or JSON format to begin." If no supplier data is given along with the greeting or if the user inquires whether a template exists, then include: "Would you like a template for the data input?" If agreed by the user, then respond with the provided CSV and JSON template examples.

DATA INPUT PROTOCOL:
Data must be provided as a markdown code block in CSV or JSON format. 

VALIDATION RULES:
Ensure all records include: supplier_id, price_score, delivery_reliability_score, and quality_rating_score. If any field is missing, respond with an error message specifying the missing field(s). Ensure price_score, delivery_reliability_score, and quality_rating_score are numeric values between 0 and 100. If not, respond with an appropriate error message.

CALCULATION STEPS:
For each supplier, perform the following calculations with detailed explanations:
1. Compute the Overall Supplier Score using the formula:
$$
\text{Overall Score} = \left(\frac{\text{price_score}}{100} \times 0.4 \right) + \left(\frac{\text{delivery_reliability_score}}{100} \times 0.3 \right) + \left(\frac{\text{quality_rating_score}}{100} \times 0.3 \right)
$$
2. Rank the suppliers based on their overall scores.

FEEDBACK PROTOCOL:
After delivering the analysis, ask: "Would you like detailed calculations for any specific supplier? Rate this analysis (1-5)." Provide tailored responses based on the user's rating.
```

## Variations and Test Flows

### Flow 1: Basic Greeting and Template Request
- **User Action:** The user greets with a simple "hi".
- **Assistant Response:** VendorSelector-AI greets back and asks if a data input template is needed.
- **User Action:** The user accepts and requests the template.
- **Assistant Response:** The system provides CSV and JSON template examples.
- **User Action:** The user submits CSV data with 6 supplier records.
- **Assistant Response:** The system processes the data, performs validations, calculates overall scores, and returns a detailed supplier evaluation report.
- **Feedback:** The user rates the analysis positively.

### Flow 2: Time-based Greeting and No Template Request
- **User Action:** The user greets with "Good morning! I'm ready to work on supplier evaluations."
- **Assistant Response:** VendorSelector-AI responds with a time-appropriate greeting and asks if a template is required.
- **User Action:** The user declines the template and provides CSV data with 7 supplier records.
- **Assistant Response:** The system processes the data and returns a detailed evaluation report.
- **Feedback:** The user rates the analysis as 5, prompting a positive acknowledgment.

### Flow 3: JSON Data with Errors and Corrections
- **User Action:** The user submits JSON data containing 15 supplier records, but some entries have missing required fields or invalid score values.
- **Assistant Response:** VendorSelector-AI detects the errors (e.g., missing `quality_rating_score` or scores outside the 0–100 range) and returns clear error messages.
- **User Action:** The user corrects the errors and resubmits valid JSON data.
- **Assistant Response:** The system processes the corrected data and returns a comprehensive evaluation report.
- **Feedback:** The user rates the analysis as 4, prompting the assistant to thank them for the constructive feedback.

### Flow 4: JSON Data with Invalid Data Types and Subsequent Corrections
- **User Action:** The user provides JSON data with 10 supplier records but uses non-numeric values (like text) for score fields.
- **Assistant Response:** VendorSelector-AI identifies the data type issues and returns an error message specifying the problematic entries.
- **User Action:** The user then submits the correctly formatted JSON data.
- **Assistant Response:** The system processes the valid data and delivers a detailed evaluation report with clear calculations.
- **Feedback:** The user provides further feedback, and the system acknowledges suggestions for improvement.

## Conclusion

VendorSelector-AI is a robust and user-friendly tool that automates the process of supplier evaluation. By enforcing strict data validation rules and providing clear, step-by-step calculations, the system ensures accurate supplier rankings, enabling businesses to make well-informed decisions. The diverse test flows demonstrate the system's ability to handle various data input scenarios—from simple greetings and template requests to handling errors in JSON data—while continuously refining its performance based on user feedback. This case study highlights how VendorSelector-AI simplifies complex supplier assessments, making it an invaluable asset for decision-makers in any organization.
